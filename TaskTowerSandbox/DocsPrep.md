## Options

> Note that check intervals have a hard coded minimum of 500ms

## How Task Tower Works

1. Jobs are created (e.g. using an `Enqueue`, `Schedule`, etc.)
   1. When a job is inserted and should be processed immediately, it is immediately enqueued using a database trigger
   2. When a job is inserted and should be processed at a later time, Task Tower will poll at at a `JobCheckInterval` to be enqueued
2. Task Tower will check the queue at an interval of `QueueAnnouncementInterval` based on whatever prioritization strategy has been configured and announce jobs for processing using Postges' `pg_notify`
3. Task Tower will be listening for announced jobs and process them

## Benchmarks

TBD

## Queues

There are a various different queuing prioritization strategies that can be used in Task Tower. Jobs with no recognized queue will be considered a lowest priority based on whatever rules apply to the type of prioritization.

> ðŸ’¡ By default, all jobs will be added to a `default` queue unless otherwise designated

### None (FIFO)

This prioritization strategy will process jobs using no particular prioritization and just behavior in a simple first-in-first-out (FIFO) fashion.

### Alphanumeric

This prioritization strategy will process jobs using an alphanumeric order based on teh queue name. If you are coming from Hangfire and need pairity with their queue behavior, you can lean on this.

Example:

```c#
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.QueuePrioritization = QueuePrioritization.AlphaNumeric();
    // ....
});
```

### Index

If you need to create multiple queues and want to prioritize processing of all jobs in one queue over other queues, you can use the `Index` option. This means that jobs will be pulled from the queue sorted in the priory designated in the configuration.

Example:

```c#
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.QueuePriorities = new Dictionary<string, int>
    {
        {"critical", 3},
        {"default", 2},
        {"low", 1}
    };
    x.QueuePrioritization = QueuePrioritization.Index();
    // ....
});
```

This example will configure Task Tower to have three queue priorities: **critical**, **default**, and **low** with strict priority. When using the `Index` priority, the queues with higher a priority will be prioritized at the top of the queue for processing.

### Strict

If you need to create multiple queues and need to process all tasks in one queue over other queues, you can use the `Strict` option. Only queues that are given a priority will be recognized and ran when using this strategy. Jobs in unprioritized queues (that are not configured with a priority in the Task Tower config) will not be picked up for processing.

Example:

```c#
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.QueuePriorities = new Dictionary<string, int>
    {
        {"critical", 3},
        {"default", 2},
        {"low", 1}
    };
    x.QueuePrioritization = QueuePrioritization.Strict();
    // ....
});
```

This example will configure Task Tower to have three queue priorities: **critical**, **default**, and **low** with strict priority. In strict priority mode, the queues with higher priority is always processed first, and queues with lower priority is processed only if all the other queues with higher priorities are empty.

So in this example, tasks in **critical** queue is always processed first. If **critical** queue is empty, then **default** queue is processed. If both **critical** and **default** queue are empty, then **low** queue is processed.

### Weighted ðŸš§

**TBD**

The number associated with the queue name is the priority level for the queue.

With this above configuration:

- tasks in **critical** queue will be processed **60%** of the time
- tasks in **default** queue will be processed **30%** of the time
- tasks in **low** queue will be processed **10%** of the time

Example:

```c#
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.QueuePriorities = new Dictionary<string, int>
    {
        {"high", 60},
        {"default", 30},
        {"low", 10}
    };
    x.QueuePrioritization = QueuePrioritization.Weighted();
    // ....
});
```



## Tags

You can use the background client to add tags to jobs to allow for easier categorization and filtering of jobs, facilitating  quick identification and management of related tasks. Tags also enhance monitoring and debugging capabilities to let you efficiently track job execution and diagnose issues within specific job  groups.

You can add tags to a job using a variety of APIs.

```csharp
var command = new DoAThing.Command("this is a tagged job");
var jobId = await client.Enqueue<DoAThing>(x => x.Handle(command));

client.TagJob(jobId, "tag1")
    .TagJob(jobId, "tag2");

await client.TagJobAsync(jobId, "tag3");
await client.TagJobAsync(jobId,  ["tag4"]);

client.TagJob(jobId, "tag5", "tag6");
client.TagJob(jobId, ["tag7", "tag8", "tag9"]);
client.TagJob(jobId,  ["tag10", "tag11"]);
```

## Job Configuration

There several different options that can be used to configure jobs in Task Tower.

- `SetQueue()` can be used to configure jobs to be sent to a particular queue
  - If a queue is not set, the job will be sent to the `default` queue
- `SetDisplayName()` can be used to give a job a human readable name in the Task Tower UI
- `SetMaxRetryCount()` can be used to set the maximum number of times a job can be retried
  - By default, a job will be retried 10 times with a progressive backoff strategy
- `WithPreProcessingInterceptor()` can be used to add an interceptor to a job that will run before the job is processed
- `WithDeathInterceptor()` can be used to add an interceptor to a job that will run after the job has been marked as `Dead` (i.e. has failed all retries)

For example:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.AddJobConfiguration<DoAPossiblyFailingThing>()
        .SetQueue("critical")
        .SetDisplayName("Possibly Failing Task")
        .SetMaxRetryCount(2)
        .WithPreProcessingInterceptor<JobWithUserContextInterceptor>()
        .WithDeathInterceptor<SlackSaysDeathInterceptor>();
  	//...
});
```

## Job Contextualizers and Interceptors

Task tower providers interceptors for performing activities during various stages of a job's lifecycle.

- `PreProcessing`: runs before processing a job
- `Death`: runs after a job has been marked as `Dead` (i.e. has failed all retries)

For example, if I wanted to send a slack notification when a job is dead, I could make an interceptor like this:

```csharp
public class FakeSlackService()
{
    public void SendMessage(string channel, string message)
    {
        Log.Information("Sending message to the '{Channel}' channel: '{Message}'", channel, message);
    }
}

public class SlackSaysDeathInterceptor : JobInterceptor
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    
    public SlackSaysDeathInterceptor(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) : base(serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(serviceProvider));
    }

    public override JobServiceProvider Intercept(JobInterceptorContext interceptorContext)
    {
        var jobId = interceptorContext.Job.Id;
        var errorDetails = interceptorContext.ErrorDetails;
        var fakeSlackService = _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<FakeSlackService>();
        
        fakeSlackService.SendMessage("death", $"""
                                               Job {jobId} has died with error: {errorDetails?.Message} at {errorDetails?.OccurredAt}. Here's the details
                                               
                                               {errorDetails?.Details}
                                               """);

        return new JobServiceProvider(_serviceProvider);
    }
}
```

And then add it to a job like this in your configuration:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.AddJobConfiguration<DoAPossiblyFailingThing>()
        .SetQueue("critical")
        .SetDisplayName("Possibly Failing Task")
        .SetMaxRetryCount(2)
        .WithDeathInterceptor<SlackSaysDeathInterceptor>();
  	//...
});
```

Interceptors can be stacked if you want:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.AddJobConfiguration<DoAPossiblyFailingThing>()
        .SetQueue("critical")
        .SetDisplayName("Possibly Failing Task")
        .SetMaxRetryCount(2)
        .WithDeathInterceptor<SlackSaysDeathInterceptor>()
        .WithDeathInterceptor<TeamsSaysDeathInterceptor>();
  	//...
});
```

An example of an inerceptor being used internally is hydrating `ITaskTowerRunnerContext` so that job id's can be accessed inside a job.

### Context Parameters

You can also provide additional context when enqueuing your jobs that can be used during interception. 

For example, say we usually get our user information from `HttpContext`, but since we don't have access to this when running a job, we want to make a new custom job context `ExampleJobRunnerContext` that can hold the user info for us an be accessible during a job.

Let's say we have this job that will be able to get the user form the param when passed in, but also from our example `IExampleJobRunnerContext` using DI in the context of a job.

```csharp
public class JobToDoAContextualizerThing(IExampleJobRunnerContext exampleJobRunnerContext)
{
    public sealed record Command(string? User) : IJobWithUserContext;
    
    public async Task Handle(Command request)
    {
        Log.Information("Handled JobToDoAContextualizerThing with a user from the param as: {RequestUser} and from the context as: {UserContextUser}", 
            request.User, 
            exampleJobRunnerContext?.User);
    }
}
```

First, let's make a contextualizer that can get a user from the job parameters and add it to the Task Tower `JobContext`.

```csharp
public class CurrentUserAssignmentContext : IJobContextualizer
{
    public void EnrichContext(JobContext context)
    {
        var user = jobParameters?.User;

        if(user == null)
            throw new Exception($"A User could not be established");

        context.SetJobContextParameter("User", user);
    }
}
```

Now we can make an interceptor to get this user out of context and into our `ExampleJobRunnerContext`:

```csharp
public class JobWithUserContextInterceptor : JobInterceptor
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    
    public JobWithUserContextInterceptor(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) : base(serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(serviceProvider));
    }

    public override JobServiceProvider Intercept(JobInterceptorContext interceptorContext)
    {
        var user = interceptorContext.GetContextParameter<string>("User");
        
        if (user == null)
        {
            return base.Intercept(interceptorContext);
        }

        var exampleJobRunnerContext = _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IExampleJobRunnerContext>();
        exampleJobRunnerContext.User = user;

        return new JobServiceProvider(_serviceProvider);
    }
}
```

And configure our job to user this interceptor during preprocessing so we have the user added to the service provider and accessible while the job is running:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IExampleJobRunnerContext, ExampleJobRunnerContext>();
builder.Services.AddTaskTower(builder.Configuration,x =>
{
    x.AddJobConfiguration<DoAContextualizerThing>()
        .WithPreProcessingInterceptor<JobWithUserContextInterceptor>();
  	//...
});
```

And finally, we can use that context when we enqueue our job:

```csharp
var command = new JobToDoAContextualizerThing.Command(user);
var jobId = await client
    .WithContext<JobUserAssignmentContext>()
    .Enqueue<JobToDoAContextualizerThing>(x => x.Handle(command));
```

## Accessing a Job's Id within the Job

It's fairly common to want to access a job's id while in a job. To do this with Task Tower, you can just inject `ITaskTowerRunnerContext` and access it from there. For example:

```csharp
public class DoAnInjectableJobRunnerThing(ITaskTowerRunnerContext context)
{
    public async Task Handle()
    {
        Log.Information("I am running a job with an Id of {Id} that I got from context", context.JobId);
    }
}
```
